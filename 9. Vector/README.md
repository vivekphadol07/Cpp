# Vector  
- Like Dynamic arrays that can resize dynamically at runtime.           
- They are stored contiguously in memory.       

**Cearting :**      
- vector<int> vec;          
- vector<int> vec2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};           
- vector<int> vec3 (5 , -1);                    

**2D Vector :**         
- vector< vector<int> matrix >
